I fell into photography completely by accident. I was like 15 or something and my mother told me I should do some activities outside of school. Without forcing me in any way, she brought me to a place where they teach all kinds of stuff like dance, yoga, comedy, improv, marquetry and‚Ä¶ not photography per se but development of analog films (B&W only). That sounded like fun, so I chose that class.

But in order to develop analog films, you have to take pictures first. So I did and I had so much fun back then taking pictures, developing films and putting photos on paper that I got hooked.\
So hooked that at some point, when I finished high school without knowing what to do with my life, I decided to go to a photography school. I enjoyed it as much as I could but French education system is not the best to enjoy learning.

I learned a lot though, I had a lot of fun but, even though my photography was getting better, I couldn't stop thinking that this wasn't what I wanted to do for a living. I considered myself not good enough in a field full of way more talented people than me already struggling to earn their lives. I was so afraid that, if I did this for a living, that I would be forced to do shitty jobs that would make me disgusted with photography.

So I kept it as a hobby. And here we are.
