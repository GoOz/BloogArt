## Origins

I fell into photography completely by accident. I was like 15 or something and my mother told me I should do some activities outside of school. So she brought me to a place where they teach all kinds of stuff like dance, yoga, comedy, improv, marquetry and‚Ä¶ not photography per se but development & printing of analog films (B&W only). That sounded like fun, so I chose that class.

Though in order to develop analog films you have to take pictures first. So I did and I had so much fun back then taking pictures, developing films and putting photos on paper that I got hooked.\
So hooked that at some point, when I finished high school without knowing what to do with my life, I decided to go to a photography school.

I learned a lot, I had a lot of fun but, even though my photography was getting better, I couldn't stop thinking that this wasn't what I wanted to do for a living. I considered myself not good enough in a field full of way people more talented than me, already struggling to earn their lives. I was so afraid, if I did this for a living, that I would be forced to do shitty jobs that would make me disgusted with photography.

So I kept it as a hobby.

## Nowadays

Twenty years later I'm still struggling to define my photography since I can't stop myself from capturing so many different kinds of pictures. Whether it's landscape in nature, portraits, street, urban, still life, composition focused or even emotional focused, I can't choose.

But why choose? Why denying myself a pleasure for the sake of a signature style?\
Until I found a viable answer to that question, I'm going to continue doing what I like.
